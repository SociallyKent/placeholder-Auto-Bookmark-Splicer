Place notes at times you wish for a bookmark. Text (or paste) into the input box, select the notes you wish to place bookmarks, and press enter.

V0.8 offers button to deletion input for fast resting, stylish and easy visuals for editing text, adjustable sizes with reset button, of course the Enter button, and a fun display of bookmarks created.

For V1, I plan to add a built in bookmark deletor, try fix any choppines as well as make it even more friend to use. More feedback and option for explaintion of using, though is very simple so won't be toggle off rather on.
